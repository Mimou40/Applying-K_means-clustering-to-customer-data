## Customer Segmentation using k-means Clustering

This project explores the application of k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, for customer segmentation. By analyzing customer data, we can identify distinct groups with similar characteristics, allowing for targeted marketing campaigns and improved customer engagement.

**Getting Started**

1. **Requirements:** This project requires Python 3 and several libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Ensure you have these libraries installed using `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`.
2. **Running the Notebook:** Activate your preferred Python environment (if applicable) and navigate to the directory containing this README and the Jupyter Notebook file (`Applying-K_means-clustering-to-customer-data.ipynb`). Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook Applying-K_means-clustering-to-customer-data.ipynb
```

**Data**

This project utilizes a customer dataset containing information such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (in k$), and Spending Score (1-100). The data (replace "Data/customers.csv" with the actual path if using a different dataset) is assumed to be pre-loaded within the Jupyter Notebook.

**Methodology**

1. **k-means Clustering:** The project employs k-means clustering to group customers based on their annual income and spending score. K-means iteratively assigns data points to clusters, minimizing the distance between each point and its cluster center (centroid). The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, which analyzes the sum of squared distances (inertia) within each cluster for varying cluster counts.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** After identifying the optimal number of clusters, customer data is segmented based on cluster membership. We analyze the average values for features like age, income, and spending score within each cluster. Additionally, the gender distribution within each cluster is explored.

**Results**

The project identifies a set of customer segments with distinct characteristics based on their annual income and spending behavior. This segmentation allows us to:

* Understand customer behavior patterns within each group.
* Target specific marketing campaigns towards relevant customer segments.
* Develop strategies to increase customer engagement and retention.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of k-means clustering in customer segmentation. By analyzing customer data, we can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and tailor marketing efforts for improved results. It's important to consider limitations of this approach, such as the potential for overfitting or the need for domain-specific expertise in interpreting the clusters. Further exploration could involve incorporating additional customer attributes or employing more sophisticated clustering techniques.
